    <h1>Minh's Notes:</h1>
<div class="concept">
<h2>Lesson 1: Basic Web Info & HTML</h2><br>
<h3>World Wide Web (WWW)</h3><br>
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is main type of document on the World Wide Web<br>
- All types of files can be found (i.e. plain text, html, video, images, music)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>Major Pieces of the Web</h3><br>
- Computers run Web Browsers (i.e. Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) protocol to communicate on the Internet to access resources/data on Web Servers<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3><br>
- HTML is made up of text (what you see), markup (what it looks like), and certain references if any (e.g. images, videos, or other docs)
- HTML is comprised of structure with components called "tags"<br>
- A complete HTML structure of a tag can be referenced as "element," with an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag<br>
- Link to good video explanation <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253">here</a><br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>Computers are Stupid</h3><br>
- Computers literally have to take instructions from what programmers give to them in code<br>
- Small mistakes can lead to huge problems when given to "Stupid" computers<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>Inline vs Block</h3><br>
- Certain tags are considered <em>inline tags</em> (i.e. break tags, emphasis tags, and image tags) which end the line while <em>block tags</em> (i.e. paragraph tags) place a virtual box surrounding the content<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h2>Lesson 2: Creating Structured Documents with HTML<h2><br>
<h3>"Tree-Like Structure" of HTML</h3><br>
- HTML code can be seen as a tree-like structure due to fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside them forming "nested" boxes<br>
- The more nested the HTML elements, the deeper the code can be viewed with deeper indentations<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>Tools Programmers Use to Write HTML Code</h3><br>
- Text editing programs (i.e. Sublime Text) make life easier for programmers<br>
- Scratchpad.io text editor is great for immediate feedback and small projects<br>
- Codepen.io text editor is great for sharing projects to the public or with others<br>
- Sublime Text editor is more powerful with advanced features and versatile for larger projects<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style & HTML Structure</h2><br>
<h3>What is CSS?</h3><br>
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is code written to control "styles" of HTML elements<br>
- "Cascading" means the most specific rule that describes the element that gets applied<br>
- Inheritance is important concept and key feature in CSS by which properties are applied not only to specific elements, but also its descendants<br>
- Several CSS files or sheets can be referenced in HTML  
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>How to Include CSS Styling in a Web Page?</h3><br>
- Method 1: Write CSS in the (head) of HTML<br>
- Method 2: Link your HTM to separate CSS file (most likely method)<br>
- Method 3: Write CSS Style <b>Inline</b> with HTML<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>The Box Model and Positioning of Boxes</h3><br>
- CSS has structure in relation to boxes for efficient design and layout<br>
- The Box Model consists of Margin, Border, Padding, and Content
- The size of your HTML element is the sum of Border, Padding, and Content<br>
- DIVs are <b>Block</b> elements, so by default they take up the entire width of a page<br>
- Adding rule <b>display: flex</b> to appropriate CSS will override the above behavior and let DIVs appear next to each other<br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="concept">
<h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3><br>
1. Look for Natural Boxes<br>
2. Look for Repeated Styles and Semantic Elements<br>
3. Write your HTML<br>
4. Apply Styles (From Biggest to Smallest)<br>
5. Fix Things<br>
